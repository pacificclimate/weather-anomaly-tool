## Production

### Docker

We currently deploy all apps using Docker.
This project contains [Docker infrastructure](../docker) and a
[GitHub action](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml) that automatically
builds and tags a Docker image on each commit. The image name is
`pcic/weather-anomaly-tool`.

### Configuration, environment variables, and Docker

It is best practice to configure a web app externally, at run-time,
typically using environment variables for any simple (atomic, e.g.,
string) configuration values.

Here we run into a problem introduced by CRA:
CRA injects environment variables only at _build time_, not at run time.
["The environment variables are embedded during the build time. Since Create React App produces a static
HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it canâ€™t possibly read them at runtime."](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).

We deploy our apps with Docker. A natural approach to build (`npm build`)
the app as part of building the image, and then just serve it from a
container. Because of CRA's build-time injection of environment
variables, such Docker images cannot be configured at run-time (i.e.,
when a container is run). Only static, build-time environment variables
are available to CRA apps inside such images.

It takes some extra effort to inject run-time environment variables (or
configuration generally) into Dockerized CRA applications. There are
two basic approaches:

1. Build the app, and inject run-time environment variables, as part of
   the image run (i.e., the commands run by the image include building
   the app, which at that point has access to environment variables
   provided via the `docker run` command).
   -This is simple but it means that containers are slow to start up
   and contain a lot of infrastructure (Node.js, etc.) needed to build
   the image. This isn't an issue for us, because we don't start many
   instances and we don't do it often.

2. Fetch the environment variables (or a configuration file) from the server.
   - This approach has several variants, which are outlined in this
     [CRA issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2353).

A key requirement is to be able to configure at run time the the URL at
which the app is deployed. CRA provides a (build-time) environment
variable for this, `PUBLIC_URL`.

Option 1 makes setting `PUBLIC_URL` simple and requires no change to the codebase;
as noted, we don't care about the cost of using such containers.

Option 2 makes setting `PUBLIC_URL` _much_ harder to accomplish, and
would require significant changes to the codebase.

Therefore, we use option 1.

### Deployment

We are now or will shortly be using Portainer to manage deployment to a Docker swarm. Please consult the relevant system documentation for more information.

Note: All **deployment environment variables**, except `REACT_APP_APP_VERSION`,
are provided by `docker/docker-compose.yaml` (and any `*.env` files it
names). `REACT_APP_APP_VERSION` is set during image build (see
`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`), and it should not be set
otherwise.

This is different from **development environment variables**, which are
provided by the `.env.*` files found in the project root directory.
(Also, `REACT_APP_APP_VERSION` is not set for development.)
