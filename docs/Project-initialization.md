# Project initialization

Initial steps taken to create the project

## Node.js and related tools

### `nvm`

To manage Node.js and its versions, we installed
[Node Version Manager (`nvm`)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md),
following its installation script.

`nvm` installs Node.js and `npm`, so there is no need to install them first.

## Application skeleton

We used `create-react-app` to create an application skeleton.
