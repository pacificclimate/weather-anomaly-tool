## Query Hooks.

Query hooks are reusable custom hooks that leverage react-query to fetch server side state. react-query acts
as a caching layer that handles refetching, caching, stale times and async loading states.

I recommend [Practical React Query](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/practical-react-query) for guidance on best practices.
