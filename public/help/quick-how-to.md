To view the monthly anomaly, observation, or baseline value of a weather variable for a particular month and year:

1. Click the weather variable of interest (**Precipitation**, **T<sub>min</sub>**, or **T<sub>max</sub>**).
2. Click the value type of interest (**Anomaly**, **Monthly**, or **Baseline**).
3. Use the date sliders to choose the month and year of interest. (For baseline values, only the month is selectable, since the baseline is a multi-year average of the selected month.)
4. The map displays markers at each station representing the data values corresponding to those selections.
5. Look at the colour bar at the top of the map to get an idea of what data ranges the colours represent.
6. Click on a map marker to see station metadata (name, location, etc.) and precise anomaly data values for that station.
