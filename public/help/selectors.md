The selectors on the left-hand side determine what is displayed on the map. They are intended to read as an English sentence of the form "Display `<observation variable>` `<value type>` for `<period>`." A couple of examples of this sentence:

- Display T<sub>min</sub> Anomaly for Jun 2020.
- Display Precipitation Baseline for Feb.

Selectors

_Variable_: To select the observation variable, click on one of the three buttons labelled **Precipitation**, **T<sub>min</sub>**, or **T<sub>max</sub>**. The selected button is highlighted.

_Value type_: To select the value type shown, click on one of the three buttons labelled **Anomaly**, **Monthly**, or **Baseline**.

_Month_: To select the period month, click or drag the top slider to the desired month.

- To decrement or increment the month selected, click the **-_N_** or **+_N_** button below the month slider. (_N_ here is the number of months by which to change the selection. The default is 1 month, so the buttons are labelled **-1** and **+1**.)
- To change the increment, use the drop-down between the buttons.
- These buttons can be useful to step uniformly through the months available while looking at the map.
- Note that decrementing or incrementing the month carries across year boundaries. For example, incrementing +1 from Dec 2020 changes the selection to Jan 2021.

_Year_: To select the period year, click or drag the top slider to the desired year.

- To decrement or increment the year selected, click the **-_N_** or **+_N_** button below the year slider. (_N_ here is the number of years by which to change the selection. The default is 1 year, so the buttons are labelled **-1** and **+1**.)
- To change the increment, use the drop-down between the buttons.
- These buttons can be useful to step uniformly through the years available while looking at the map.
